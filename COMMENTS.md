## Architecture

I have used MVVM as main architecture. because it helps to make testing easy and we can avoid bulky view controller files.


## Third-party libraries

* Alamofire
	* For network calls.
*  SwiftMessages
	* To show error or info messages.
* SwiftGen
	* To generate Swift code for resources.

 Cocoapods is used for dependency management.

  ## What Could be improved 

- Could have add more testing. Currently i have only added tests for 1 view controller and 1 view model.
- Add realm to save user posts.
- Could have swift UI since requirement was iOS 13+.
- Better handling of cache especilly when it should expire.
